The APP:

The lig-aikuma app has so many versions, all were tried on my andriod phone but unfortunately none was working or compatible with my phone, so I was left with no other choice than to use the android studio with the Lig-Aon my computer system. 

The Tutorial:

The tutorial consist of the Mercer Mayer wordless picture book of 1969 Frog (saved as frog story file), the image-by-image version of the book. The speach elicitation by image was done in the Nigerian Pidgin. The short speech were then concatenated using the online tools and afterwards converted to .wav file. The the Translating of the elicitated speech was done using the ibibio language. These two languages are from the western and southen part of Nigeria respectively.
